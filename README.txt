** DESCRIPTION:

BFTS is a branch of rubicon with the intent of auditing all of rubicon
against the latest version of 1.8.x, stripping all the cruft, and
getting everything up to date again. rubicon is dead and the authors
have shown no interest in getting things moving again. BFTS hopes to
fix that.
